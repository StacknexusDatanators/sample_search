<p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Customer 360 Lens</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recency Frequency and Monitoring (RMF) Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>The integration of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis within Customer 360 (C360) lenses has empowered businesses to deeply understand customer behaviour and tailor marketing strategies effectively. By analyzing recent interactions (Recency), frequency of engagement (Frequency), and monetary contributions (Monetary Value), C360 segments customers into groups. This segmentation helps identify high-value, loyal customers for personalized engagement strategies. It also highlights dormant segments requiring re-engagement tactics to prevent potential churn. Utilizing RFM within C360 lenses elevates targeted marketing, enhances customer experiences, and fosters long-term loyalty, driving revenue growth and informed decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Recency:</strong> Recency in RFM analysis within C360 lenses illuminates recent customer engagements, indicating their current activity levels and potential ongoing interactions. This metric enables businesses to identify active customers more likely to respond to immediate marketing strategies or personalized offers. Leveraging recency insights allows for targeted engagement, potentially boosting immediate sales or eliciting prompt customer responses, thus elevating overall customer satisfaction and engagement levels.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Frequency analysis in C360 lenses delves into customer engagement consistency, signifying customer loyalty and habitual interactions. This aspect identifies highly engaged customers, forming the foundation for strategies aimed at retaining loyalty and encouraging repeat interactions. Segmentation and understanding of high-frequency customers empower businesses to design targeted marketing efforts and loyalty programs tailored to maintain and potentially increase these customers' lifetime value, ensuring sustained revenue streams.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> within C360 lenses' Monetary Value assessment, involves continual tracking of customer transactions and their impact on overall revenue. This process identifies high-value customers whose spending significantly influences business success. Through ongoing monitoring, tailored strategies like exclusive offers or personalized services are applied to retain and increase spending from these customers. Prioritizing enhanced experiences for such clientele maximizes their contribution to the company's financial success.</p>

<li><p><strong>Source Data Updates:</strong> Quality checks align with the update frequency of source data. For datasets with more dynamic sources, such as real-time transactions, checks may be more frequent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Needs:</strong> The frequency is also tailored to meet specific business requirements and decision-making cycles. Critical datasets may undergo more frequent assessments to support timely and accurate decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Volume and Complexity:</strong> Larger datasets or those with intricate relationships may require more frequent checks to maintain a high level of data quality.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By incorporating these quality metrics and aligning checks with relevant factors, the Customer 360 Data Product ensures that the information driving business decisions remains accurate, reliable, and up-to-date.</p>

<p><strong>Data Update Frequency:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Customer Dataset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Daily</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Customer profiles are dynamic and subject to frequent changes. Daily updates ensure that the system reflects the most recent customer interactions, preferences, and behaviours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Product Dataset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Weekly</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Orders Dataset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Real-time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Given the critical nature of order data, updates occur in real-time to capture transactions as they happen. This enables prompt responses to changes in customer behaviour and facilitates accurate order fulfilment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transactions Dataset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Daily</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Daily updates ensure that transactional data, including payment information and order details, are current. This frequency aligns with the need for up-to-date insights into customer purchasing behaviour.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Order Line Item Dataset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Real-time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Real-time updates are crucial for granular details related to order line items. This ensures that any changes or modifications are immediately reflected in the dataset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web Analytics Dataset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Hourly</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explanantion:</strong> Web analytics data can offer insights into customer interactions in near real-time. Hourly updates allow for quick adaptation to changing online behaviours and trends.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brands Dataset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Weekly</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Brand-related information, such as partnerships or product launches, may not change as frequently. Weekly updates strike a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></li>
