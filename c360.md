**Customer 360 Lens**

**Recency Frequency and Monitoring (RMF) Analysis:**

The integration of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis within Customer 360 (C360) lenses has empowered businesses to deeply understand customer behaviour and tailor marketing strategies effectively. By analyzing recent interactions (Recency), frequency of engagement (Frequency), and monetary contributions (Monetary Value), C360 segments customers into groups. This segmentation helps identify high-value, loyal customers for personalized engagement strategies. It also highlights dormant segments requiring re-engagement tactics to prevent potential churn. Utilizing RFM within C360 lenses elevates targeted marketing, enhances customer experiences, and fosters long-term loyalty, driving revenue growth and informed decision-making.

**Recency:** Recency in RFM analysis within C360 lenses illuminates recent customer engagements, indicating their current activity levels and potential ongoing interactions. This metric enables businesses to identify active customers more likely to respond to immediate marketing strategies or personalized offers. Leveraging recency insights allows for targeted engagement, potentially boosting immediate sales or eliciting prompt customer responses, thus elevating overall customer satisfaction and engagement levels.

**Frequency:** Frequency analysis in C360 lenses delves into customer engagement consistency, signifying customer loyalty and habitual interactions. This aspect identifies highly engaged customers, forming the foundation for strategies aimed at retaining loyalty and encouraging repeat interactions. Segmentation and understanding of high-frequency customers empower businesses to design targeted marketing efforts and loyalty programs tailored to maintain and potentially increase these customers' lifetime value, ensuring sustained revenue streams.

**Monitoring:** within C360 lenses' Monetary Value assessment, involves continual tracking of customer transactions and their impact on overall revenue. This process identifies high-value customers whose spending significantly influences business success. Through ongoing monitoring, tailored strategies like exclusive offers or personalized services are applied to retain and increase spending from these customers. Prioritizing enhanced experiences for such clientele maximizes their contribution to the company's financial success.

**Security:** C360 employs a security framework encompassing encryption, access control, and audit trails. Through advanced encryption techniques, the product secures data both during transit and at rest, shielding sensitive customer information from unauthorized access or breaches. Access control mechanisms, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), limit data access based on user roles. This ensures that only authorized personnel, like Data Stewards or Data Producers, can access specific information while employing data masking techniques for sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Detailed audit trails track and monitor user activities and changes made to customer profiles, fostering accountability and enabling rapid identification of any potential security threats or unauthorized alterations. These robust security measures collectively fortify the platform against vulnerabilities and ensure the protection of customer data from various threats.

**Compliance:** C360 aligns with pertinent compliance standards and regulations, underscoring its commitment to data privacy, protection, and responsible data management. Adhering to stringent data privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the product implements stringent measures to safeguard customer data, ensuring lawful and ethical handling practices. Additionally, the establishment of data retention policies within C360 ensures secure data storage and responsible disposal, in compliance with stipulated retention periods and privacy requirements. These compliance efforts not only foster customer trust by upholding data integrity and privacy but also mitigate risks associated with legal and regulatory implications.

By integrating security measures and aligning with stringent compliance standards, the Customer 360 data product not only guarantees data confidentiality and integrity but also ensures ethical data handling practices. This comprehensive approach to security and compliance within C360 instils confidence in users and organizations, fostering trust in the platform's capability to handle sensitive customer information responsibly and securely across its data ecosystem.

**Example how a lens query works:**

The query exemplifies a Customer 360 lens in action, showcasing its ability to extract specific insights. By focusing on Californian customers, it retrieves details such as the total customer count and segmented profiles like "High Spending Customers" or "Expecting Parents." This demonstrates the lens's capability to distill vast datasets into actionable customer attributes, facilitating targeted decision-making and personalized engagement strategies.

**Sample Query:**

| SELECT \* FROM LENS ( SELECT "customer.total\_customers", "segment.segment\_name" FROM c360\_solution\_accelerator WHERE "customer.state"='California' LIMIT 50000 ) |
| --- |

**Sample Output:**

| **customer/total\_customers** COUNT | **segment/segment\_name** STRING |
| --- | --- |
| 106 | High Spending Customers |
| 4 | Expecting Parents |
| 1 | Frequent Cart Abandoner |
| 1 | Frequent Buyers |

**Sample of a TrinoSQL based query connection:**

The Python script connects to a TrinoSQL server and queries ten records from the 'clickstream' table in the 'retail\_acclerator' database. This connection uses HTTPS authentication with specific headers for access, allowing easy data retrieval from TrinoSQL servers using Python.

**Sample of TrinoSQL connection in python and query:**

| conn = connect( host="tcp.cheerful-maggot.dataos.app", port="7432",auth=BasicAuthentication("user\_name","YXRsYXNfZTc1YzFhNjZhZTQwNmRiN2QyZjQ1MWI"), http\_scheme="https", http\_headers={"cluster-name": "minervac"} ) |
| --- |
| Query = '''SELECT \* FROM icebasedev.retail\_acclerator.clickstream LIMIT 10''' |

**Beacon:**

The Beacon API endpoint, serves a crucial role in the realm of retail analytics. Specifically designed for churn prediction, this API retrieves data from a PostgreSQL database, a robust open-source relational database system. Operating within the DataOS platform, the API is integral to forecasting customer churn in retail scenarios. By leveraging the capabilities of PostgreSQL and the DataOS environment, it plays a key role in providing valuable insights for businesses aiming to anticipate and address customer attrition effectively.
